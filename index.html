				<p>Hi, you can call me Henry. I am a website and mobile apps developer. I have created many complicated websites like e-commerce, payment gateway, and many more. Now I am still learning to become a full-stack developer on both website and mobile apps. Right now, I'm joining a group as a web developer and UI designer. We are currently starting a new startup company called Donate. Feel free to contact me on my social media below.
				After I graduate, I have several wishlists like working on a top-notch company like Google or other companies. But, I want to have my own company or startup, that's why I hope Donate to become a successful startup by the time I'm graduate.
				</p>
